          <p className="about-me-text">As a former marketer and salesperson, I am passionate about forging relationships and making visions come to life.
          My enthusiasm for programming began at a young age when I first created content to mimic my favorite websites.  That fascination has stayed 
          with me throughout the years, and has inspired me to pursue a career change that offers high levels of creativity and problem solving.  Above all, I love learning new things!  
          When Iâ€™m not behind a computer, you can find me outdoors at a bluegrass concert, rock climbing, or exploring the nearest hiking trail.</p>
